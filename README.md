# What's this then?
It's a full stack practice exercise assigned as homework for a software development course. On the front end, it uses the [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) web framework and [jinja2](https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/) templates to interface between [Python](https://www.python.org/) and HTML. On the back end, [Psycopg](https://www.psycopg.org/) allows Python-based access to an SQL database via [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).

# Yes, yes, very good, but what do I do with it?
It's basically just a really limited web application (because it's more intended as a simple practice exercise than as an actually useful piece of software) which manages museum attractions. If you looked at [ccl23](https://github.com/crabbit-git/ccl23-books_by_authors), this will probably look rather familiar. If you want to mess around with it, you can install and run Flask from the root directory then open the web page(s) in a browser.
